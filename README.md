Project Model:

Our model is basically the representation of a Smart Campus. Student life forms the most technologically active community, and thus our idea is to build a project based on Smart Campuses, which can later be expanded and implemented to form Smart Cities.
We have made an Android Application on this topic, which has covered two aspects of a Smart Campus:
1. Smart Health
2. Smart Transport



Our Application:

Each Student has a unique E-mail ID and a unique Student ID. The student registers to the Smart Campus Application and then logs in after the required validation is done. The information of the student is stored in a database.


The first aspect covered by us is Smart Health. Smart Health includes a wearable Smart Band which is worn around the wrist of a user and synced to the student's mobile. This Smart Band is able to detect various body activities of the user, such as Heart Rate, Oxygen Level, Blood Viscosity and Blood Pressure and send this information directly to the user's phone. In case a student wishes to send any health-related information to his/her doctor, we have included a Share functionality, which enables the student to directly share this by means of Email, SMS, WhatsApp and other such apps present on the user's phone. In case any abnormal conditions are detected, the Application has the functionality to send an SOS to the user's emergency contact. Hence, Smart Health helps deal with unforeseen health issues, as well as makes sharing of health-related information quick and simple.


The second aspect covered by us is Smart Transport. Smart Transport is basically a system involving self-driven cars in which the map of the campus is fed in, beforehand. This system especially favours students from colleges having a huge campus, who need to travel from point to point, within the campus. The user is required to enter his/her Unique Student ID, along with the start and end points of travel. After validation of the same, the user is redirected to a map which displays the destination. On clicking the marker, the user is provided an option to open Google Maps from where he/she is able to see the path taken by the Smart Car and thus can navigate his/her journey.
